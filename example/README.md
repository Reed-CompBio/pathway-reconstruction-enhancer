# Input data

This directory contains input network data to be used by a pathway reconstruction algorithm.

## Interactome
 Currently it contains a weighted, directed human protein-protein interaction (PPI) network `PathLinker_2018_human-ppi-weighted-cap0_75-edges.txt`

## Pathways
For now, two example pathways *EGFR1* and *Wnt* are included. Files `EGFR1-edges.txt` and `Wnt-edges.txt` are the actual curated pathways from the NetPath dataset. 
The source (receptor) and target (tf) nodes are listed in files `EGFR1-sources.txt`, `Wnt-sources.txt` and `EGFR1-targets.txt`, `Wnt-targets.txt` respectively for the two pathways.
